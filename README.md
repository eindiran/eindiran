### About me

I work on speech recognition systems as a computational linguist and software engineer at [Promptu Systems](http://promptu.com/), in the Bay Area. In my spare time, I play around with quantified self projects in [The Basement](https://github.com/TeamBasement), most recently the mood-tracking app [Sitrus](https://sitrus.io). You can find me here, on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eindiran), or on [this blog](https://www.unadulterated-faff.com/) that I'm always promising myself I'll write on more often.

My public key is on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/eindiran).
